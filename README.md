# Pidge Stitcher for ChatGPT Content

## Overview
The Pidge Stitcher is designed specifically for handling and refining the output from generative AIs like ChatGPT. It aims to streamline a series of AI-generated content by removing redundant preambles and conclusions in consecutive AI messages, thereby producing a more cohesive story.

## Problem Statement
ChatGPT, as with many generative AIs, often adds a preamble at the start of its messages, such as setting up the scene or a prefix like "Okay, certainly I'd love to help with that." These AI messages also conclude with summaries or endings, like "I hope you found this helpful." When generating a story across multiple messages, these repetitive beginnings and ends can disrupt the flow.

## Solution
The Pidge Stitcher addresses this by blending and stitching messages together. It segments each message into thirds (top, middle, bottom) and then merges the last third of a message with the first third of the subsequent message, aiming to create a smoother transition and a unified body of content.

## How it Works

1. **Segmentation**: Each AI message is divided into thirds - top, middle, and bottom.
2. **Stitching**: The app feeds the middle and last third of the first message and the first and middle thirds of the following message into the Stitch AI instance.
3. **Merging**: The primary objective is to merge the conclusion of one message (found in its last third) with the preamble of the subsequent message (found in its initial third). The Stitcher identifies common conclusion and preamble terms, understanding the story's direction, and creates a seamless body of text that replaces the end of one message and the beginning of the next.
4. **Output**: The stitched story feels more cohesive, providing an improved reading experience, and is saved to `output.txt`.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Pidge installed. If not, [find it here](link_to_pidge).

### Input

1. Prepare your input as a valid JSON array: an open square bracket followed by strings separated by commas. Example:

```json
["First message here.", "Second message.", "Third message..."]
```

2. This array represents the individual AI message bodies.

### Running the App

1. Pipe your input file into the Pidge Stitcher's first runtime:

```bash
cat your_input_file.json | ./pidge_stitcher_app
```

2. Upon completion, the app will generate `output.txt` containing the stitched content.

## Example

**Input**:

```json
["The adventurers began their journey.", "After some time, they reached a crossroads.", "Thinking hard, they decided to go left."]
```

**Output**:

"The adventurers began their journey and after some deliberation, they decided to go left."
